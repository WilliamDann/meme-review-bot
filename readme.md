# Minesweeper Royale
This is a minesweeper battle royale game created at CodeDay Winter 2019. The objective is to clear as much of the board as possible while avoiding bombs on the board. The application is still under development and contains many bugs, so feel free to create an issue when you see one!

### Running an Instance
The server currently crashes too much to have an official server running, but you can get an instance running on your local machine. The first step is to clone the repo, after that you should be able to run an `npm install` command and be ready to go. To run the server you use the command `node server/app.js`.

To run the server on localhost you need to set the `--hostname` argument to `localhost`. The server will run on port 3000.
